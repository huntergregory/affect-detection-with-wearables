# affect-detection-with-wearables

We pre-processed the data adn given the methodolgy that we used for upsampling (Interpolation), we were able to compress the data into a 23MB csv. 

Our thought process behind this was making the reproducibility process easier and more seemless. 

The .csv, called WESAD-one-sec-shift.csv, is included in our submission but can other be found in huntergregory/affect-detection-with-wearables:
https://github.com/huntergregory/affect-detection-with-wearables

Our report can be reproduced using this .csv in an R markdown file. 

We have provided code in the Appendix.Rmd file. Below are the locations in the Appendix where the reproducibility questions are answered:

To answer the first goal:
Simple chest and wrist model– line 381

To answer the fourth goal:
Wrist model without interactions – line 405
Wrist model with interactions – line 422

To answer the fifth goal:
Quantifying heterogeneity – line 439
